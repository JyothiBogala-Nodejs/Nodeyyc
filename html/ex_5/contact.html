<p>"I'm happy with the hard work of the players, but we did not start well. We were not able to have our possession. We won a lot of second balls which was important in this game.
    "The aim of the second half, after we scored, was to hold on and stay compact but after that we did not create many chances.

<p>"I'm very happy for Leander Dendoncker - he gives so much to us and he truly deserves this moment."
    On moving into fifth: "What's in front of us will be very tough, but it's a welcome week to recover. We will prepare ourselves to compete and see what happens."

<p>Aston Villa boss Dean Smith speaking to BBC Sport: "We were the better team before the break - not many teams have created chances against us. We more than matched a top-six team today, but they managed to get a goal from the edge of the box out of nothing, and we didn't convert the chances we had.</p>
<p>"We started the game well, put good balls in from set-pieces, but our headers were probably not as good as they should have been. I thought today was about fatigue - crazy to play four games in 11 days.</p>
<p>"Right from the start it is fine margins. I think we look a sound team, we are hard to beat and I am sure the teams we play will say that too, but we just probably need a bit of quality in the final third."</p>
