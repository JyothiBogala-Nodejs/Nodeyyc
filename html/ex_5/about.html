<p>Nuno Espirito Santo's side are now fifth in the Premier League and only two points behind fourth-place Chelsea after their third win on the spin since the restart, although the Blues have a game in hand.</p>
<p>"Everyone dreams, but we also have to be realistic," said Dendoncker. "We have some tough games coming up, but it is good - we took nine points from nine. We just have to do our best game by game."</p>
<p>Wolves, surprisingly, only managed two efforts on goal on Saturday, but the Belgium midfielder made it count with their second when he struck low past Orjan Nyland after an excursion into the area.</p>
<p>As for Dean Smith's men, they remain in 19th with 27 points. A draw could have lifted them out of the bottom three, which was as much as they looked like achieving at Villa Park.</p>
<p>Jack Grealish's first-half low, driven effort was their only shot on target.</p>
